## Project description
Currently, with regard to mental health, we are witnessing how much of a problem it is for many people. Moreover, it has been deeply aggravated in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. According to the WHO, by 2023 almost one in two people in the European Union (46%) had experienced emotional or psychosocial problems in the last 12 months.

These mental health problems also have an economic impact, costing 4% of the GDP of EU countries. Furthermore, the ‘Health at a Glance’ report carried out in 2022 showed that almost one in two young people report having unmet mental health needs. 

The depressive symptomatology of these young people in several EU countries has more than doubled since the pandemic. These data clearly show that there is a huge unmet need with regard to mental health. 

Through this project, we aim to detect depressive symptomatology in social media posts through a Dataset of posts on Reddit providing a reliable method for the detection of these individuals and their treatment.
